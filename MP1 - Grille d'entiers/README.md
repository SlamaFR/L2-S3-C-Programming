# Integers grid

Integers grid is a C written game using the MLV graphical library.

## Game summary
The game keeps playing until the sum gets equal to 100.

Every round, you have to select two cells of the grid. If the given segment is correct (horizontal, vertical or diagonal), then the sum of the numbers in this segment is scored.

The game is playable in ASCII mode or graphical mode.

## Controls

In ASCII mode, you play by inputting values.

In graphical mode, you play by clicking the cells. There is also two buttons to save or quit.

# Compilation

This game uses the MLV graphical library. It is pretty old and not up to date for Windows and MacOS.
I provided a compiled program runnable on Debian.

If you want to compile it by yourself, the library can be found here:
